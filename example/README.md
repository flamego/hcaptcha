You need a [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) account to run this example.

```shell
$ go run main.go -site-key=<SITE KEY> -secret=<SECRET>
[Flamego] Listening on 0.0.0.0:2830 (development)
...
```

Then, visit http://localhost:2830 to test different behaviors with and without completing the hCaptcha challenge.
